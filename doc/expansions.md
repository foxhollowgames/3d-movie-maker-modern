# Using expansion packs with 3DMMEx

Fox Hollow Games builds also discover custom `FHMod<source_id>` folders.
Use [Mod Workshop](../tools/mod-workshop/README.md) to import your own props, textures, and sounds.
Workshop packs use their own format. They do not require V3DMM.

3DMMEx has support for 3D Movie Maker [official and community expansion packs](https://3dmm.miraheze.org/wiki/Expansions). These expansion packs are:

* Doraemon Character Kit: official expansion pack for the Japanese release of 3D Movie Maker.
* Nickelodeon Expansion: community expansion pack containing content from Nickelodeon 3D Movie Maker.
* 3DMM Expansion Pack / "Frankie's Expansion": community expansion pack that adds new scenes, 3D Word fonts and textures.

Expansion packs are not included with 3DMMEx, as they may contain copyrighted content. Please ensure you have the rights to use them before installing.

To use an expansion pack with 3DMMEx:

1. Get the 3TH and 3CN files for the expansion. You can do this by unpacking the expansion's installer with [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/), or obtaining the files from an existing installation of 3D Movie Maker.
2. In the directory where you unpacked 3DMMEx, open the `Microsoft Kids` directory and create a subdirectory with the title name (see below)
3. Copy the expansion's 3TH and 3CN files to the subdirectory
4. Restart 3DMMEx. You should see additional content when adding new scenes, actors, props, etc.

| Expansion              | Title/Directory Name        |
|------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Doraemon Character Kit | `DORAEMON`                  |
| Nickelodeon Expansion  | `N3DMM EXPANSION`           |
| 3DMM Expansion Pack    | `EXPANSIONS`                |


## What about V3DMM Expansions?

V3DMM is a 3D Movie Maker mod loader released in 2004. 3DMMEx does not support V3DMM expansions.
